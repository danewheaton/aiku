# Aiku
Hello, anyone interested in my C# scripting abilities! This is a good example of what my code looked like in May 2018 - in the Scripts folder, I wrote everything found in the following subfolders:

- Camera
- Interfaces
- Managers
- Placeholders
- Power Transfer
- Scripted Events

And many other scripts in:

- Audio
- Objects
- Player
- Pause Menu
- UI

Feel free to browse the commit history if you'd like to see specifics, along with other things I did on the project! That's what people like to do in their spare time, right? Sift through other peoples' old commits?
